I plan to blog here regularly or at least that is what I have told myself.
This blog is setup using hexo, for html generation, and github pages, for hosting.
I went this way instead of wordpress so as to do justice to the hackers inside me.
I hope he will be satisfied.

My next blog post is going to be on my work with *Genetic Algorithms*. Stay tuned.
